## Description

This application runs entirely in the backend. It uses a sql databse that holds data of products, tags and the category of each product. Routes for each of these information are used to manipulate different aspects of the database.

## Usage

Open the application in the terminal and begin by installing npm i. Create an environment file that will connect you to the sequel databse. Procede by running the databse. Once the databse is running populate it by running the script node seeds. Then you can run the server by running node server.js. Once everything is set up use insomnia, postman or another application of your choice, input the route and you will have the ability to post, put, delete, and get the data from the database.
